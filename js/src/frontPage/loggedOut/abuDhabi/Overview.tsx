						Through online workshops and webinar sessions with senior CNN journalists, participants
						will learn how CNN gathers information, verifies sources and produces content for its
						multiple platforms. During in-person workshops at CNN Abu Dhabi, participants will get a
						behind-the-scene look at the production of the networkâ€™s flagship current affairs show,
						Connect the World with Becky Anderson, live from CNN Abu Dhabi.

						Throughout the course, participants will also work on producing their own multiplatform
						content. They will pitch a story idea, get it approved, work with a team of professional
						photographers and editors to shoot and edit it, script and present it. The best content
						will be featured on CNN. CNN Academy Abu Dhabi is tuition-free, however, participants
						need to ensure they can attend the five-week program full time.
